# portfolio-hw

##Description
-My motivation for this portfolio was o try and create a portfolio for myself.

-I built this project so that I could try and learn how to build a portfolio with css and hmtl

-This project did not really solve any problem

-I learned how to write html and css for the benefit of a website. I also learned about myself and how I learn as a new computer coder

-What makes my portfolio stannd out is nothing because I was not able to finish it properly, or maybe thats what makes it stand out. 

-What I struggled with was boxes on top of boxes, how to write html code, and most of all finding my ownstyle of writing code. Im still looking for that. 
I also struggled with my internet going out and having to hotspot through my phone to get this sent in.
